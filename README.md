# Arctic_fox_moulting Github repository - Lucie Laporte-Devylder
This repository contains all files linked to the publication of my MSc degree project on Arctic fox moulting phenological plasticty, conducted in 2022 with Lund University and The Norwegian Institute for Nature reserach (NINA).

The results from this study have been peer-reviewed and published in the journal "Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation".
