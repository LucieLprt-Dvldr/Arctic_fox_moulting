The dataset "morph phenology.csv" characterizes the differences of spring moulting phenology between white morph and blue morph arctic foxes, for moult initiation (95%), mid-point (50%), and moult completion (0%).
The data was collected for arctic foxes in Snøhetta, between the years 2011 and 2018. Seasonal values of temperature, snow parameters and rodent density index are also given.
This dataset was used to investigate the morph-based differences in moulting timing and rate for arctic foxes, in response to environmental conditions. 
The dataset was built based on pictures extracted from motion-triggered camera traps installed on supplementary feeders nearby den sites and release sites, as part of the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research's (NINA) Arctic Fox Captive Breeding and Release Programme.

Each row represents a single arctic fox, with its corresponding moulting dates for the different moulting stages observed. 

Columns explanation:
year = year of observation
rodent = rodent cycle phase reflecting abundance of locally occuring Lemmus, Myodes and Microtus species. Index values range from 1 to 4 (1 – low, 2 – increasing, 3 – peak, 4 – decreasing; see Angerbjörn et al., 2013 for details). 
temperature = average seasonal air temperature for the moulting season (April-July) for all sites, in °C.
snow_depth = Site-specific values of snow depth present on May 1st, in mm.
snow_continuous = Site-specific values of the number of days with continuous snow on the ground from January 1st.
site = location name of the camera within the study area.
morph = coat colour morph of the arctic fox (W = white, B = blue)
indiv_ID = unique identifier attributed to the observed arctic fox based on physical characteristics.
start_95 = date at which a given arctic fox was observed transiting to moult initiation (scored 95% winter fur). Dates are given in Julian day (January 1st = 1, December 31st = 366 in 2012 and 2016, 365 all other years)
median_50 = date at which a given arctic fox was observed transiting to the mid-point of moulting (scored 50% winter fur). Dates are given in Julian day (January 1st = 1, December 31st = 366 in 2012 and 2016, 365 all other years)
end_0 = date at which a given arctic fox was observed transiting to moult completion, now displaying a complete summer coat (scored 0% winter fur). Dates are given in Julian day (January 1st = 1, December 31st = 366 in 2012 and 2016, 365 all other years)
